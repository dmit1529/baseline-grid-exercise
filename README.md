A CSS baseline grid, or the vertical rhythm, on a page is a repeating pattern of spacing going down the page. Its sole purpose is for aesthetic and harmonic sizing. The consistent pattern gives structure to larger articles of text that leads the reader's eye through the content. The eye is subconsciously aware if the spacing is pleasing.

The CSS baseline grid is best used on websites with larger amounts of text, such as articles and blogs. It might not work on more complicated sites such as business websites or e-commerce. Nevertheless, it’s a good tool for the designers' toolbox.

Use either the content proved (baseline-grid-exercise) or content of your choosing style the HTML elements to perfectly fit into a baseline grid, similar to the one done in class. If using content that is different than the provided content, make sure to choose enough text and different level heading to use the h1 through h6 tags. Wikipedia articles are good for this and you are free to borrow content from the web for educational purposes.

<ol>
  <li>Set your default font size to 112.5%. This will render to 18px in the browser.</li>
  <li>Set your default line height to 1.5 </li>
  <li>Determine what the grid unit sizing will be by calculating the rendered line-height of the default text</li>
  <li>Display the grid either using the linear-gradient CSS shown in class or the Chrome Baseliner tool</li>
  <li>Choose a typographic scale of sizing to use for all the levels of headings from the h1 through to h6</li>
  <li>Resize the headings and add spacing (margins and padding) where needed, keeping all elements on the grid by adjusting the line height wherever the font size changes</li>
  <li>There is one image in the provided content, make it (or an image of your choosing) fit into the dimensions of the grid.</li>
  <li>Bring in the optimal line length (measure) for a good reading experience!</li>
</ol>


Also, check for collapsing margins and fix them as needed.

Save and bring to next class.
